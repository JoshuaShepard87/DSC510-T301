# Create a header for your program just as you have in the past.
# Create a Python Application which asks the user for their zip code or city (Your program must perform both a city and a zip lookup).
# You must ask the user which they want to perform with each iteration of the program.
# Use the zip code or city name in order to obtain weather forecast data from OpenWeatherMap.
# Display the weather forecast in a readable format to the user. Do not display the weather data in Kelvin, since this is not readable to the average person.
# You should allow the user to choose between Celsius and Fahrenheit and ideally also Kelvin.
# Use comments within the application where appropriate in order to document what the program is doing. Comments should add value to the program and describe important elements of the program.
# Use functions including a main function and a properly defined call to main. You should have multiple functions.
# Allow the user to run the program multiple times to allow them to look up weather conditions for multiple locations.
# Validate whether the user entered valid data.
# If valid data isnâ€™t presented notify the user.
# Your program should never crash with bad user input.
# Use the Requests library in order to request data from the webservice.
# Use Try blocks to ensure that your request was successful. If the connection was not successful display a message to the user.
# Use Python 3
# Use try blocks when establishing connections to the webservice.
# You must print a message to the user indicating whether or not the connection was successful.
# You must have proper coding convention including proper variable names (See PEP8).
